Independent Study - DMX and Theatre: Control Networks
=====================================================
This is the resulting code from an independent study (Hampshire College, Fall 2014) on developing hardware and basic software for entertainment technology (prototyped using an Arduino controlled platform). The two directories in this repository represent different stages in the process of controlling a servo:

-	Servo_Demo: A very simple servo control script using a button to allow user control of the servo's position.
-	Basic: A prototype of a serial controlled servo. This script does not implement any existing entertianment protocols, but allows for a demo of how serial control signals could be used to control the position of a servo.
